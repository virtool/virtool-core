### Running Tests

`tox` is used to run the tests in a fresh virtual environment with all of the test dependencies. To install it use;

```shell script
pip install tox
```

Then from the repository root;

```shell script
tox
```

### MongoDB

Some tests require an instance of MongoDB to be running on the local machine.

If you do not have MongoDB installed you can use
the [run_mongo_with_tests.sh](tests/run_mongo_with_tests.sh) script
to run mongo using docker. The docker container used to run mongo
will be stopped and removed once the tests have completed. 

### Documentation

For docstrings, use the [**Sphinx** docstring format](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html).

The packages `sphinx_rtd_theme` and `sphinx_autoapi` are used in rendering the documentation. 

```  shell script
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme sphinx_autoapi
```

#### Markdown for Sphinx

[recommonmark](https://github.com/readthedocs/recommonmark) is used so that Sphinx can 
render documentation from *markdown* files as well as *rst* files. It will need to 
be installed before running `sphinx-build`:

```shell script
pip install recommonmark
```

To use sphinx rst [directives](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html) in a *markdown* file use the 
`eval_rst` [code block](https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_structify.html#embed-restructuredtext)


#### Building the documentation

```shell script
cd sphinx && make html
```

The rendered HTML files are found under `sphinx/build/html`
