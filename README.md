### Running Tests

The testing framework used is [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). Install it using:
```shell script
pip install pytest
```

Run the tests from the root directory:
```shell script
pytest
```

### MongoDB

Some tests require an instance of MongoDB to be running on the 
local machine.

If you do not have MongoDB installed you can use
the [run_mongo_with_tests.sh](tests/run_mongo_with_tests.sh) script
to run mongo using docker. The docker container used to run mongo
will be stopped and removed once the tests have completed. 

### Documentation

For docstrings, use the [**Sphinx** docstring format](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html).

#### Markdown for Sphinx

[recommonmark](https://github.com/readthedocs/recommonmark) is used so that Sphinx can 
render documentation from *markdown* files as well as *rst* files. It will need to 
be installed before running `sphinx-build`:

```shell script
pip install recommonmark
```

To use sphinx rst [directives](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html) in a *markdown* file use the 
`eval_rst` [code block](https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_structify.html#embed-restructuredtext)


#### Building the documentation

```shell script
make html
```

The rendered HTML files are found under `build/html`
